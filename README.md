### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**`Digital Craftsman (CST Student)`**

I'm currently a CST student at [BCIT]. I love creating apps that solve real-life problems and solving challenging problems for my in-class assignments. All coding projects are created from the ground up from planning, designing, and implementing the project.
